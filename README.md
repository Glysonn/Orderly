# Orderly

**Orderly** is a microservices-based application designed to handle the entire order lifecycle — from user registration to order placement and product management. The system is being developed as a modular, scalable, and maintainable solution for both e-commerce platforms and internal order management workflows.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Orderly is composed of independent microservices that communicate through asynchronous messaging and REST APIs. Each service is loosely coupled and follows Clean Architecture principles for long-term maintainability and scalability.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Language**: C#, .NET 8
- **Architecture**: Microservices, Clean Architecture, DDD
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Dapper, FluentValidation
- **DevOps**: Docker
- **Testing**: xUnit

## 🛠️ Architecture Highlights

- **Microservices**: Each domain module (e.g., Users, Orders, Products) is implemented as an independent service.
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between API, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models represent the core business logic and behaviors.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Easy to set up, run, and deploy using Docker and Docker Compose.

## 📌 Project Purpose

Orderly is a portfolio-driven project built to showcase backend architecture with real-world patterns like microservices, DDD, and clean code practices. It demonstrates how to scale modular applications while maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.
